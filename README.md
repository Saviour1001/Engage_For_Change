# Engage for change

## Description

Hey there !! This app was made in order to chanelize the energy of youth to fill the
void of the society. We aimed to build a platform where people could connect and post
about social work and help in uplift the community. This idea was inspired during the
harsh times of Covid 19 pandemic. Its our responsibility to grow the society from where
it is now to a better future.

## How to run the source code on your computer

- Clone this repository on your machine

- Get the flutter packages you will be needing by running the following command in terminal

  `flutter packages get`

- Setup Firebase

  The app uses Firebase as backend so you will be needing to create a Firebase project of yours and set it up to get the authentication and database services up and running.
  Its very easy, just create a new Firebase project and get a google-services.json key from there and place it in the folder Engage_For_Change/android/app.
