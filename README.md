# Engage for change

## Description

Hey there !! This app was made in order to chanelize the energy of youth to fill the
void of the society. We aimed to build a platform where people could connect and post
about social work and help in uplift the community. This idea was inspired during the
harsh times of Covid 19 pandemic. Its our responsibility to grow the society from where
it is now to a better future.
